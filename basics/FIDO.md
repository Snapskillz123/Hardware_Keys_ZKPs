# FIDO
The FIDO (Fast Identity Online) protocol is a set of open standards developed to enable secure, passwordless authentication. It primarily relies on public-key cryptography to authenticate users without sending passwords over the internet, reducing the risk of phishing and credential theft. 

Here’s how it works, broken down into key steps:

## User Registration with a Service
During registration, the user connects their FIDO-compatible hardware key or device (e.g., a YubiKey or a biometric-enabled smartphone) to the service (website, app, etc.).

The FIDO device generates a unique public-private key pair for this service. The private key stays securely on the hardware device, while the public key is shared with the service and stored as the user’s identifier.
## Authentication Protocol
When the user logs in, the service sends a challenge (a random number or nonce) to the user’s FIDO device.
The FIDO device signs this challenge using its private key, creating a unique signature. This process typically requires the user to verify their identity, such as by pressing a button on the hardware key or using biometric authentication (fingerprint, face ID) on the device.

The service receives the signed challenge and uses the user’s public key (stored from the registration step) to verify the signature. If it matches, the user is authenticated successfully.
## Types of FIDO Protocols: FIDO U2F and FIDO2
### FIDO U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) 
An early version of FIDO, U2F adds a layer of security by requiring a second factor. It was designed to be a straightforward add-on to password-based logins, primarily as a second factor.
### FIDO2
A newer, more comprehensive protocol, FIDO2 is composed of the WebAuthn API and the Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). WebAuthn allows web-based applications to interact with FIDO devices for login, while CTAP handles communication between external authenticators (like hardware keys) and the user’s device. FIDO2 supports fully passwordless authentication.
## Underlying Technology: Public-Key Cryptography
FIDO relies on asymmetric cryptography, where the user’s FIDO device keeps the private key secure and the service stores the public key.

Unlike password-based systems, the private key never leaves the FIDO device, and only the public key is stored server-side. This method ensures that even if the server is breached, no passwords or private keys are compromised.
## User Privacy and Security Benefits
### Phishing Resistance
FIDO ensures that even if a phishing website tries to intercept a login attempt, it cannot access or replicate the private key needed for authentication.
### Passwordless Convenience
FIDO2 allows for truly passwordless login experiences, replacing passwords with biometric scans, security key taps, or PIN codes as part of multi-factor authentication.
### Reduced Credential Theft
Since no passwords are transmitted or stored, common attacks like brute-force attacks and credential stuffing are mitigated.
