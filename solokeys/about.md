# SoloKeys
SoloKeys is a popular open-source hardware security key designed for secure authentication. They support standards like FIDO2 and U2F (Universal 2nd Factor), enabling secure and passwordless login to online accounts. Since they're open-source, both the firmware and hardware designs are available for review and customization, which makes them unique compared to many proprietary hardware keys.

## Key Features of SoloKeys
###  FIDO2 and U2F Support:

Works with services supporting WebAuthn for passwordless authentication.
Enables two-factor authentication (2FA).
### Open Source:

Firmware and hardware designs are fully open, fostering transparency and trust.
Developers can inspect, customize, and contribute to the code.
### Hardware Security:

Uses secure microcontrollers (e.g., STM32 or nRF52 series) with cryptographic capabilities.
Supports elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and public-key cryptography.
### Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Works with Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
### Custom Firmware:

Users can flash their own firmware, enabling experimentation or additional features.
### Cryptography in SoloKeys
#### Algorithms:

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):
Uses NIST P-256 or Ed25519 curves for cryptographic operations.
SHA-256:
For hashing challenges and responses.
HMAC-SHA256:
Used in secure authentication protocols.
AES (optional, for secure storage or additional features in custom firmware).
Authentication Protocols:

Implements challenge-response authentication.
Supports asymmetric cryptography for securely verifying identities.
### Key Management:

Private keys are securely stored in the device and never exposed.
Keys are generated on-device to ensure they remain confidential.
## Use Cases
### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

Add a second layer of security for accounts like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft.
### Passwordless Login:

Use the FIDO2/WebAuthn protocol to authenticate without a password.
### Custom Security Applications:

Developers can build custom cryptographic applications using the open-source firmware.
